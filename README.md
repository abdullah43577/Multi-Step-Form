## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Logic is everything in programming, If I was more logical while building this project, the code wouldn't have been as complicated as it is. I learnt a lot of things while building this, and I'll take it into consideration whenever I'm building my future projects.

```

### Continued development

I'll continue developing myself on the logical aspects of building projects
